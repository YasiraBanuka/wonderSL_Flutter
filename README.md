WonderSL is an application to be developed by positioning the satellite view of the best
traveling places in Sri Lanka through the map within the application. This mainly focuses on
voyages and those curious to travel but cannot make it work due to their busy life
schedule. This recommends suitable places via the application and through notifications for
the users according to their interests and the flexibility of their lifestyle where the application
is aware of their timeframes. The users can view the recommendations and the location's details in detail as images, and descriptions with the weather forecast.
