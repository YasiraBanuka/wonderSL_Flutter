# wondersl

This is our SPM Project in 3rd Year 1st Semester.

## Recommendation Based Personalized Tour Planner

WonderSL is an application to be developed by positioning the satellite view of the best
travelling places in Sri Lanka through the map within the application. This mainly focuses the
voyages and those who are curious to travel but cannot make it work due to the busy life
schedule. This recommends suitable places via the application and through notifications for
the users according to their interests and the flexibility of their lifestyle where the application
is aware about their timeframes. The users can view the recommendations and view the
details of the location in detail as images, description with the weather forecast.

Here are some UI screenshots from this app.
